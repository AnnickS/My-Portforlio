              <p>I had the opportunity to work with Toyota Connected North America on their Immersive Experiences team 
                through Apex Systems as a contractor, assisting in the creation of 4 different prototypes.</p>
                <p>Three of our prototypes were developed in Unity 3D, and one in Unreal Engine 5.2 where I had 
                  the opportunity to work with 4 different plugins and develop multiple blueprints to interact 
                  with UI features and game objects.</p>
                <p>This work required collaboration with product owners to convert business requirements into 
                  technical tasks. I also worked closely with our UI artist to revise feature requests to fit within 
                  budget and time constraints. </p>
                <p>On the team, I assisted in the completion of the Isodynamic Seat Simulator which was coded in 
                  Unity 3D, where I was in charge of creating gameplay features by scripting them in C# and 
                  implementing them onto game objects in the scene. I developed a data storage system to compare 
                  lap times and save them in a .json file, created a feature that would counteract the vehicle 
                  potentially flipping, and developed the end-game scoreboard, as well as assisted in ironing out 
                  bugs and developing other minor features.</p>
                <p>Our work on the Isodynamic Seat Simulator was displayed Halloween week at the SEMA convention 
                  in Las Vegas, where I helped run the booth for exhibit goers to experience.</p>
