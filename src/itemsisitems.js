                    Items is Items is a 2D RPG created as a senior project I 
                    assisted in developing alongside 2 other Bellevue College 
                    students. Developed in Unity 2D, our focus was to create a 
                    game where all objects were interactable and had a purpose 
                    existing in the game.

                    As an assistant working at the Bellevue College XR Lab I
                    construct workshops that are presented to classes across a
                    variety of vocations to help facilitate student learning,
                    while maintaining a focus on Virtual Reality.

                    In my spare time I play Dungeons and Dragons with friends,
                    game socially, and write short vignettes. My friends and
                    family are of highest importance to me, so when I can I
                    spend my time visiting and connecting with others.
